- A current Software Engineer Intern at Jahnel Group, Greg is working towards his current goal - becoming a much better Web Developer and
- more broadly a Software Developer. He loves the technology that goes into this field, and strives to learn as much as he can since he was given an opportunity to learn at Jahnel.
- Web development is his strong suit currently, but he would love to eventually start strengthening his skill as a lower level programmer - specifically in C++ and Rust.
