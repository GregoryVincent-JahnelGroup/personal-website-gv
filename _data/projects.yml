- name: GAV Consulting
  description: A work in progress React SPA for Gregory Vincent Sr's Consulting Business. Created with Vite in order to get experience
    with the faster build tool, and being developed in Typescript to get experience with the JS Superset. Managing emails is the next challenge for this project 
    will probably be done through learning some basic PHP, or through Amazon SES! This project also has responsive and a mobile first design in mind, over 
    project 2, which was developed when I didn't understand that concept. 

- name: GKV RealEstate
  description: My first ever React SPA hosted with AWS Amplify in Summer of 2022. Serves as a basic demo for what a website may look like
    for GKV RealEstate. Now that I have more experience and knowledge in the Web Dev field I'd like to update it - switch development over to Vite from CRA as it 
    gets more complex(and to Typescript since it's much safer), add MUCH needed Responsive Design, code splitting, and update the pictures in the image gallery.

- name: Anonymous Messaging
  description: A work in progress chat-application started in November of 2022. The idea is to get much more comfortable with Fullstack Development and take my skillset
    beyond just using React and other front-end technology. I chose the MERN stack as my beginner framework since I already had prior experience with React and Node.
    This project will probably finished after my internship at Jahnel - when I have much more experience working with Fullstack(and Serverless) technologies. In terms of
    functionality, I'd like to emulate something like GroupMe with a twist - the name of each sender changes periodically! Not super useful, but a fun idea I had. Could be
    used for muystery games or something of that nature. 

- name: Java Computer Simulation
  description: This project was created to simulate the basic inner workings of a computer in Java throughout the Fall 2022 school year. The final project hosted on main 
    is the culmination of different componnents( like a RippleAdder, Multiplier, Assembly, Memory Simulation) working together. It also allows the user who downloads the code
    to run some basic Machine Language commands! Very fun to create and work with.
